Our gens consists of 10 shots
we should calculate the final distances of balls to the holes + the rewards for scoring - penalties for removing white ball as our fitness function.

then after 30 generations we select the elit and let the first 10 shots to be the elit for the first 30 generation,
    and repeat the process for the next 10 shots.

we repeat this until we score all the balls.

there should be a login mechanism for each generation, so that it can be used for cool videos maybe?
------------------------
this is the steps for the genetic algorithm:
1. Initialize Population: Create a random population of chromosomes.

2. Evaluate Fitness: Calculate the fitness of each individual in the population.

3. Select Parents: Choose parents based on their fitness (e.g., roulette wheel, tournament selection).

4. Crossover: Combine selected parents to create offspring by swapping parts of their chromosomes.

5. Mutation: Apply random changes to some offspring's chromosomes (e.g., adjust cue ball position or stick angle).

6. Create New Generation: Form the new population from the offspring, ensuring the population size remains constant.
